### Introduction

Here I came up with the game plan for the whole application so I could write cleaner and concise code with a clear focus in mind.  Keep in mind that I did this in only 5 days, so Iâ€™m considering this an MVP of the product.

### Model  

It is a platform endless running game.

### Story

Since it is an endless running game, and since I did not have that much time to work on it, it is really simple. The main character works in an organization that saves pets, and he needs to arrive in time to the sick pet to apply the right medicine before the worst happens.

### Gameplay

#### Player

The player control a  simple small character that initially can only jump two times.

### Stages

Each stage has a different speed, clock time and enemy to avoid.

Chapter one 1: It is a city  and the enemy is a big rat.

Chapter two: A Cave and the enemy is a spider.

Chapter three: A Florest and the enemy is a flame.

### Free Mode

You can choose any chapter you want, just to get as more points as you want.
